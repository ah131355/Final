    <h1 style="font-size: 30px">Cheerleading</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">Here at Davenport West I participated in the cheerleading team from sophomore through senior year. In a stunt group you have four people; two bases, a flyer and a backspot, I was a backspot. My sophomore year I cheered on the JV squad and
    and my junior and senior years I cheered on the varsity squad. Other than the spirit squads I was also on the competiton team for my junior and senior years.
   My junior year we got second at state, but unfortunately my senior year we didn't place. Our girls group however, which consisted of me, Naomi Walker, Katie Roseman,
 and Gracie Guttierez, got first place! Cheering at the football and basketball games, participating in the pep rallys, and walking the halls on game days were
definitely some of the highlights of my highschool career. Now that I'm graduating this year and cheer season is over, I'm already starting to miss it.   </p>
<h1 style="font-size:30px">Traveling</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px">Aside from cheerleading I also love going new places and seeing new things. Of the 50 states I've been to 15 and outside of the U.S. I've been to Mexico and Canada.
I plan to increase the list throughout my life until I'm no longer able to. Some of my favorite places I've been to are the Carolinas and Florida. I pretty
much enjoy anywhere on the coast that's warm. This summer I plan to return to South Carolina and also to Florida. I will also be going to Minnesota again with my family
in July. </p>
