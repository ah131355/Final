    <p style="font-size: 20px">In this class we've created many websites and I've learned about a variety different web languages such as html, javascript, css and others.
    Javascript was my favorite because it adds interaction to the web page and makes it more exciting to look at. I'd like to learn more
  about Javascript because I think it would be cool to play around with all of the different elements you can add to a web page and to invent my own.
  Below are some of the websites I've enjoyed creating in this class. </p>
