      <h1>Occupation</h1>
      <p style="font-size:18px">I will be graduating from Davenport West High School June 3rd of 2018. In the fall I'm going to attend Scott Community of Riverdale to earn a degree in sonography to become an ultrasound tech. Here I will
      hopefully get into the radiologist technician program and from there go on the the ultrasound technicican program. By being a full time student I should
      be able to graduate within two years if not sooner. In the future if I want to further my education I will go to a university. I plan to live at home to save money and I have applied for scholarship as well. So far I have been
      awarded the Connections scholarship which is earned by completing 12 college credit classes in high school.

    <h1>Future Goals</h1>
    <p style="font-size:18px">In the near future I hopefully will be traveling all over the world. I will go to as many states, countries, and continents as
    I can before I die. I specifically want to go to all the tropical ones. I hope to be middle to upper class with a nice house and an even nicer car. My future husband and I
  will each have a dog and I will have a cat. This will be my family. </p>
