<p style="font-size:20px">I am 18 years old and live with my family in Blue Grass, IA. We have two dogs, Coco and Ollie. Coco is a chunky chocolate lab mix
and Ollie is a dachsund yorkie mix. My family is very involved in sports as all three of my brothers play baseball and my dad is president of
the blue grass town ball league. He also coaches one of the teams as well as his own travel ball team called the QC (Lion) Pride. Baseball is not the only
sport my brothers participate in. Austyn plays golf and is in band and Adam plays basketball and hockey. My mom is very busy with all of the sporting
events and activities, but she still manages to cook dinner, clean our house, and excercise.  </p></article>
